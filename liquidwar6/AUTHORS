List of Liquid War 6 authors / contributors. 

Thomas Colcombet : invented Liquid War rules, drew some of LW3 maps.

Christian Mauduit <ufoot@ufoot.org> : main developper, project maintainer.

Kasper Hviid : drew all the "kasper" maps.

Many people contributed to Liquid War 5, their names are not listed here,
but without them Liquid War 6 would obviously never have been started. 
Special thanks to all of them. However this is not a direct contribution
to the project, in terms of code and other copyrightable materials.
