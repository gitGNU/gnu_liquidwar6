 * These values are set from ./configure script. They are
 * Liquid War 6 specific and are therefore not in config.h
 * which is handled by autoconf and contains "standard" values.
 * The fact that this file is changed each time one runs
 * ./configure with new options garantees that files are actually
 * compiled with the right options. Additionnally, it avoids
 * passing a bazillions -DLW6_VAR=value options to the compiler.
 * And in can be installed in $prefix/include so that one knows
 * how things have been compiled.
