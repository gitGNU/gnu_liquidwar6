Ink and Oil


IDEA
I finally finished a tush a ink drawing I had started a long time ago. In Photoshop, the drawing was inverted and combined with a monotype painting I had created with oil paint.

GAMEPLAY
I have set single-army-size and total-armies-size pretty low. fighter-new-health is only 50 while fighter-defense is as high as 250. Notice the sharp black lines where the armies fights. Pretty!
