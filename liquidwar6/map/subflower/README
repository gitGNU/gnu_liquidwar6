Sub Flower

A level with flowers in it. I tried to give it a underwater feel.
Painted with pen and ink. Colored in Photoshop.

GAMEPLAY
I honestly can't remember why I did whatever I did. But I think it's okay.

TEAM COLORS
The whole level has a cyan multiply-layer on top. So has the teams.
