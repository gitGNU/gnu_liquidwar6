IDEA
This level began with the idea of using a twisted, horizontal wraparound in a level, where it looks like there are a non-twisted horizontal wraparound. Why does this sound like nonsense when I try to express it in words? Another idea in this level is the use of two separated areas, only connected by wraparounds. It is created with Photoshop CS3. I tried to make it look a bit like an old map.

GAMEPLAY
The fighters have zero defense, but I let them regenerate instead. They have zero side attack, which means that they will attack in one direction only. Also, their priorities lies in moving towards the cursor, they are only fighting when they absolutly has to. The result is some fighters which can really dig into the enemy. Their behavior have a very natural look, almost like plants or fractals. As mentioned above, the map contains two areas only connected by wraparounds. I have let the area below have a slower time, using glue.png

TEAM COLORS
I have tinted the colors a bit to make them blend into the yellow tone of the map.
