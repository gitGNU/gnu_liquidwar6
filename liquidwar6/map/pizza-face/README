Pizza Face

IDEA
This level began with the idea of several horizontal wraparound passages, which are pushed together at the edge of the screen.
The texture is painted with pencil and pen, and colorized in Photoshop CS3. I tried to make this level brighter than usual, and I am quite sure that I failed. I also tried to make the aspect ratio close to the 16:10 widescreen format.

GAMEPLAY
Really low defense, but extremely high regenerate instead. Interesting.
