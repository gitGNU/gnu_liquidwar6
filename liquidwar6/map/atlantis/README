Atlantis


IDEA
I drew a labyrinth on paper, scanned it and traced its outline in Illustrator. I did the painting in Photoshop CS3. It ended up looking quite cool. It took a while to draw all the ornaments, though. 

GAMEPLAY
I have aimed at somewhat large armies, to fill out a large part of the labyrinth. Most of the settings are the default. fighter-attack is 1200 (normally 500) and fighter-defence is 200 (normally 50) This is to speed thing up a bit. The level still suffer from the problem that it is quite hard to finish an enemy off.

TEAM COLORS
The colors of the armies are has a lower saturation, and tinted a bit towards the color of the background. The idea was to give them an underwater feel. It is a bit hard to change the colors, since you also wants it to be possible to distingust each of the ten individual teams from each others. If you want to change the colors, do it in your drawing program. Don't try to guess the right hex values.

MENU COLORS
The dark color is "sailor blue", the bright color is cyan. (When you need a bright color, alway pick one of those hues which are naturally bright, such as cyan or yellow. Semilar, if you need a dark colors, select one of the hues which a naturally dark)
