Strange New World

IDEA
This is a bit of fanart, a remake of one of the classic Liquid War levels. The 1:1 aspect ratio is kept for historical reasons. It is painted in Photoshop CS3. The background is one of my monotype paintings. I hope that step wasn't to bold.

MUSIC
The music is the original thmoov.mid from Liquid War 5.

GAMEPLAY
I have tried to keep this one as LW5 as possible, using normal colors for the fighters and pixilation. I didn't change the fighter-values.

MENU COLORS
The menu colors inspired by Liquid War 5: Red text on black background.
