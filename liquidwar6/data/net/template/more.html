    <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Liquid War 6 is a unique multiplayer wargame. Your army is a blob of
        liquid and you have to try and eat your opponents. Rules are very
        simple yet original, they have been invented by Thomas Colcombet. It
        is possible to play alone against the computer but the game is really
        designed to be played with friends, on a single computer, on a LAN, or
        on Internet.

    <h3>How to use this server</h3>
      <p>
        This page is served by a
        <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/liquidwar6/">Liquid War 6</a>
        server.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means on the computer this page is served from, someone
        is playing
        <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/liquidwar6/">Liquid War 6</a>
        or, at least, is trying to play it.
        Logically, unless there are some firewalls and/or web proxies
        denying you and/or this server a full Internet access, you
        could run
        <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/liquidwar6/">Liquid War 6</a>,
        select this server address, connect to it, and go multiplayer.
      </p>
      <p>
        This server also shows you a periodically updated
        <a href="/screenshot.jpeg">screenshot</a> of the game,
        which gives you an idea of what's going on.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also maintains a <a href="/list.txt">list of all public servers</a>
        which can be usefull to find other computers/people to connect to
        and play with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, a <a href="/status.txt">status page</a> can inform you
        of what's going on, from a technical point of view.
      </p>
    <h3>Usefull links</h3>
      <ul>
