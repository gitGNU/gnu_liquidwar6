This  directory  contains  all  the  data  for  Liquid  War  6.   Each
subdirectory should contain its README  file explaining what it is all
about. Note  that it is very  important to release data  under the GNU
GPL along with the  code, for a game without the data  which make it a
playable (and  possibly fun) game is  not really a game  any more, but
merely an  empty game engine. Some  files are dual  licensed under the
GNU  GPL and some  other more  artwork oriented  licenses such  as the
"Creative  Commons  Attribution-ShareAlike  2.5"  or  the  "Free  Art"
license. The main  reason is that generally, the GNU  GPL might not be
truely adapted for  purely artistic contents, and some  of the artwork
in Liquid War 6 might not  be 100% specific to this game.  However, in
the context  of Liquid War  6, which is  a program, using the  GNU GPL
does make sense,  for there is not such an  obvious limit between code
and data (code might embed  data, and data might embed code) therefore
using the GNU GPL as a global  license does make sense. If you want to
contribute to Liquid  War 6 and provide artwork,  it is recommended to
either  release it  under the  GNU GPL  and/or dual  license  it under
whatever license  fits your  needs as an  artist, and the  GNU General
Public License.
