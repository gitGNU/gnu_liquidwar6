Liquid War 6 is a unique multiplayer wargame. Your army is a blob of
liquid and you have to try and eat your opponents. Rules are very
simple yet original, they have been invented by Thomas Colcombet. It
is possible to play alone against the computer but the game is really
designed to be played with friends, on a single computer, on a LAN, or
on Internet.

Liquid War 6 is a GNU package (http://www.gnu.org).

WARNING: this is an a beta release of the upcoming "6.x.x" branch.
So there's nothing playable yet. I you're searching for a playable
version, see http://www.ufoot.org/liquidwar/v5 ("5.x.x" branch).

The liquidwar6-extra-maps package contains extra maps for the game.
It has been separated for there are many maps and package is too big.

This is the core liquidwar6 package.

Have a nice day,

U-Foot.
