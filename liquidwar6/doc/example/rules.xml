    This is an example Liquid War 6 'rules.xml' file. This file can be put
    along with a 'map.png' file to set up some parameters to your own
    preferred values. However, it's not required, a map can live without any
    'rules.xml' file, defaults will be used, that's all. Note that this
    example only defines a few parameters, there are many more of them. The
    idea is to modify just the settings which are important for your map, and
    let the user choose the best values for other items. Happy hacking!

  <!--
    "rounds-per-sec" (default="50", min="1", max="200"): Defines the overall
    speed of the game. All other settings being equal, raising this value will
    cause the game to behave faster. Everything will be faster, except
    probably the display since your computer will calculate more game
    positions in a given time and spend more CPU time. It will also increase
    network traffic. Values between 10 and 50 really make sense.
  -->
  <int key="rounds-per-sec" value="45"/>
  <!--
    "moves-per-round" (default="2", min="1", max="50"): Defines how many times
    fighters move per round. Increasing this will just make fighters move
    faster, but won't change anything for the rest, that is keyboard and mouse
    responsivity, and network traffic will stay the same. Multiplying the
    number of moves per round by the number of rounds per second will give the
    number of moves per second, which is, in fact, how fast fighters move on
    the screen.

  <int key="moves-per-round" value="2"/>
  <!--
    "start-red-x" (default="10", min="0", max="100"): X start position for the
    red team. This is a percentage of map width, value between 0 and 100.
  -->
  <int key="start-red-x" value="50"/>
  <!--
    "start-red-y" (default="10", min="0", max="100"): Y start position for the
    red team. This is a percentage of map height, value between 0 and 100.
  -->
  <int key="start-red-y" value="50"/>
  <!--
    "start-green-x" (default="90", min="0", max="100"): X start position for
    the green team. This is a percentage of map width, value between 0 and
    100.
  -->
  <int key="start-green-x" value="50"/>
  <!--
    "start-green-y" (default="90", min="0", max="100"): Y start position for
    the green team. This is a percentage of map height, value between 0 and
    100.
  -->
  <int key="start-green-y" value="5"/>
  <!--
    "start-blue-x" (default="90", min="0", max="100"): X start position for
    the blue team. This is a percentage of map width, value between 0 and 100.
  -->
  <int key="start-blue-x" value="50"/>
  <!--
    "start-blue-y" (default="10", min="0", max="100"): Y start position for
    the blue team. This is a percentage of map height, value between 0 and
    100.
