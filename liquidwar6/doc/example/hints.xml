    This is an example Liquid War 6 'hints.xml' file. This file can be put
    along with a 'map.png' file to change the behavior of the map. It is used
    by the map loader to decide wether it should, for instance, adapt the map
    to the screen size, guess colors automatically, and such things. It does
    not really define any real map parameter, it just give clues to the map
    loader. Note that this example only defines a few parameters, there are
    many more of them. The idea is to modify just the settings which are
    important for your map, and let the user choose the best values for other
    items. Happy hacking!

  <!--
    "fighter-scale" (default="1.0"): Defines how wide (in pixels) fighters
    must be. This parameter is very important and will largely condition the
    number of fighters on the map. It is used when loading the map. If it is,
    for instance, set to 1, there will be exactly a fighter per pixel on the
    screen. That is, if you play 640x480 on an empty map, the maximum fighters
    you could have is about 300000. The idea is that by changing the
    resolution, you also define the density of the map. In pratice, this is
    done in the hope that someone with a slow computer will pick up a low
    resolution and therefore play small levels. Conversely, someone with a
    brand new computer with powerfull CPU & GPU will use great resolutions and
    be happy with many fighters on the map. Still, changing the resolution
    after loading the map will not affet the number of fighters. Same for
    network games, the first player, who loads the map, defines its properties
    according to its own settings.

  <float key="fighter-scale" value="2.500000"/>
  <!--
    "system-color-auto" (default="true"): Defines wether system colors will be
    set automatically from base and alternate colors. This is a time saver to
    keep map designers from requiring to redefined every single color in the
    game. You only need to set color-base-bg, color-base-fg,
    color-alternate-bg and color-alternate-fg. Then system_color_bg and
    system_color_fg will be automatically set.
