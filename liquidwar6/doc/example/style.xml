    This is an example Liquid War 6 'style.xml' file. This file can be put
    along with a 'map.png' file to change the look of the map. It will not
    change the gameplay at all, all gameplay related parameters are in
    'rules.xml', and, to some extent, 'hints.xml'. This file is not required,
    a map can live without any 'style.xml' file, defaults will be used, that's
    all. Note that this example only defines a few parameters, there are many
    more of them. The idea is to modify just the settings which are important
    for your map, and let the user choose the best values for other items.
    Happy hacking!

  <!--
    "guess-colors" (default="true"): Defines wether colors should be set
    automatically from texture colors. If set to true, then the program will
    try to pick up colors automatically from the texture, and will override
    the values of the color-base-bg, color-base-fg, color-alternate-bg and
    color-alternate-fg parameters. How these colors are picked up can't be
    garanteed, so if the map does not have strong contrast or if there can be
    any form of ambiguity, it's safe to set this to false and define one's own
    colors.

    "color-base-bg" (default="#000000"): Defines the base color, more
    precisely, its bg (background) part. Colors are always defined by a bg/fg
    pair. Most colors in the game can be deduced from this one, usually to
    color a map you only need to define color-base-bg, color-base-fg,
    color-alternate-bg and color-alternate-fg.

    "color-base-fg" (default="#cccccc"): Defines the base color, more
    precisely, its fg (foreground) part. Colors are always defined by a bg/fg
    pair. Most colors in the game can be deduced from this one, usually to
    color a map you only need to define color-base-bg, color-base-fg,
    color-alternate-bg and color-alternate-fg.
