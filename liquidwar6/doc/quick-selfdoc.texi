@subsection about
@deffn {Command-line option} @code{--about=<value>}
Type: string

Will allow you to get informations about a given keyword. Let's say that, for
instance, you want informations about the keyword 'map-path'. Simply run
'liquidwar6 --about=map-path'. Note that this internal self-documentation
system can describe command line switches as well as XML config file
parameters or environment variables, and even some Guile script functions. The
'--list' command line switch will give you the list of all available keywords.
