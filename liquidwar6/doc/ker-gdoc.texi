@deftypefun {int} {lw6ker_test} (int @var{mode})
@var{mode}:  0 for check only, 1 for full test

Runs the @code{ker} module test suite. Will perform deep checksums
and *really* check many things. If this passes, the algorithm
is fine. What could make it fail is a serious bug and/or some
weird combination of endianess, byte alignment...

@strong{Return value:}  1 if test is successfull, 0 on error.
@end deftypefun
