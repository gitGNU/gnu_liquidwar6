Type: integer

Default value: 3
Min value: 0

@deffnx {XML key} @code{color-conflict-mode}
Type: integer

Default value: 1
Min value: 0
Max value: 2

How to handle color conflicts, that is, when a player requests a color, but
this color is already used, what should be done? If 0, wether a color already
exists won't affect the color of a new cursor. If 1, then two players on the
same computer will be allowed to share the same color/team, but if another
computer is already playing with a color, any new computer will need to use
another team. If 2, then it's impossible for a new cursor to use a
pre-existing color, any new cursor will require a new color, if that color is
already used, a new color will be picked randomly.

Type: integer

Default value: 200
Min value: 0
Max value: 10000

Defines how dangerous are the black zones defined in 'danger.png'. The value
is used to decrease the fighter health at each move, so you should compare its
value to something like 'fighter-attack'. Being on a dangerous zone is a bit
like being attacked by an invisible and unknown ennemy.

@deffnx {XML key} @code{fighter-attack}
Type: integer

Default value: 500
Min value: 1
Max value: 10000

Defines how hard fighters will attack others, that is, in one attack, how many
life-points the attacked fighter will loose. Increasing this will cause your
opponents to melt faster when you attack them. With a low value, it will take
ages to take on your opponents. Different styles of game. Can radically change
the gameplay.

Type: integer

Default value: 50
Min value: 0
Max value: 10000

Defines how fast fighters will regenerate after an attack. When this parameter
is set low, an attacked fighter, which is very dark and almost dead will take
a very long time to regain energy. If the parameter is set high, it can almost
instantaneously regain energy.

Type: integer

Default value: 5000
Min value: 1
Max value: 10000

Defines how healthy fighters will be when they appear on the map. This can be
either at the beginning of the game of when a fighter changes team. Setting
this low will allow battefields to switch from one side to another very fast,
for freshly gained fighters will be feeble and very likely to return to their
original camp. To calibrate this parameter, keep in mind that the absolute
maximum health a fighter can have is always 10000 (ten-thousands).

Type: integer

Default value: 5
Min value: 0
Max value: 10000

Defines at which speed fighters will self-regenerate, without even begin

@deffnx {XML key} @code{max-cursor-pot-offset}
Type: integer

Default value: 100
Min value: 1
Max value: 10000

Defines the maximum cursor potential offset. The idea is that in some cases,
the potential of a cursor can increase in burst mode, for instance to make
this cursor more important than others, so that fighters rally to it,
neglecting other cursors (talking about a multi-cursor controlled team). This
parameter is here to limit this burst effect and avoid bugs.

Type: integer

Default value: 1000
Min value: 1
Max value: 10000

This is the companion value of 'round-delta'. Will put an absolute limit to
the delta, which (what did you think?) is of course incremented in some cases
by the core algorithm. If in doubt, don't touch.

@deffnx {XML key} @code{max-zone-size}
Type: integer

Default value: 8
Min value: 1
Max value: 64

Defines the maximum zone size, which is an internal and rather technical
parameter. The idea is that to optimize things, Liquid War 6 divides the
battlefield in squares, where it can, and tries to make these squares as big
as possible, the idea being that everywhere in this square, fighters follow
the same intructions. Just a technical optimization. The problem is that
setting it too high will reveal the optimization and its tradeoffs to the
player, who will see the fighter behave strangely, following invisible paths.
Plus, it's ugly. Depending on your tastes (speed, look'n'feel) you'll prefer
something nice or something fast. Note that anyways passed a certain value,
this does not optimize anything anymore. In doubt, don't touch it.

Type: integer

Default value: 100
Min value: 0
Max value: 10000

Defines how fast fighter will automatically regenerate on black zones defined
in 'medicine.png'. The value is used to decrease the fighter health at each
move, so you should compare its value to something like 'fighter-defense'.
Being on a medicined zone is a bit like being defended by an invisible and

Type: integer

Default value: 2
Min value: 1
Max value: 50

Defines how many times fighters move per round. Increasing this will just make
fighters move faster, but won't change anything for the rest, that is keyboard
and mouse responsivity, and network traffic will stay the same. Multiplying
the number of moves per round by the number of rounds per second will give the
number of moves per second, which is, in fact, how fast fighters move on the
screen.

Type: integer

Default value: 3
Min value: 1
Max value: 7

Defines how many tries a fighter will do before giving-up attacking and
choosing another behvior (defense). By tries we mean: how many directions it
will try. Going North? Going North-West? Setting this to a low value will make
fighters somewhat less aggressive. This idea is that they'll prefer to switch
to the next option, that is, defense/regeneration, if there's no opponent
right in front of them.

Type: integer

Default value: 1

Defines how many tries a fighter will do before giving-up attacking and
choosing another behavior (do nothing). By tries we mean: how many directions
it will try. Going North? Going North-West? Setting this to a low value,
you'll need a very compact pack of fighters for regeneration to operate, else
fighters will hang arround unhealthy.

Type: integer

Default value: 5
Min value: 3
Max value: 7

Defines how many tries a fighter will do before giving-up moving and choosing
another behvior (attack or defense). By tries we mean: how many directions it
will try. Going North? Going North-West? Setting this to a low value, your
fighters will look very stubborn and always try to move in one direction,
neglecting the fact that they could dodge. This can lead to queues of fighters
and other strange behaviors. On the other hand, setting it too high will cause
fighter to always avoid the enemy, and groups of fighters will just pass each
other without any fight. Matter of taste.

Type: integer

Default value: 1
Min value: 0
Max value: 1

Defines what to do when a team dies. If set to 0, team disappears forever, if
set to 1, team reappears automatically with fresh fighters. It's a deathmatch
mode, where the winner is not the one who stays alive the longest time, since
it makes no real sens in this case, but the one who has died less often than
others.

@deffnx {Environment variable} @code{LW6_ROUND_DELTA}

Type: integer

Default value: 1
Min value: 0
Max value: 100

Conditions by how much the cursor potential will be incremented each time
gradient is spreaded. Sounds cryptic? It is. The idea is that at each time you
move your cursor of 1 pixel, theorically, you'll need in the worst case to
move of 1 more pixel to reach any point on the map. Of course this is not true
but this is the default asumption, and gradient spread will fix that. Only in
Liquid War 6 this is not even the worst case, for you can control your cursor
with the mouse and cross walls. Whenever you cross a wall, you might have done
a great distance from the fighters' point of view, if the map is a maze. Thus
this parameter, which corrects things, experience shows it does give
acceptable results to increase the cursor potential by more than one at each
turn. Toy arround with this if you find fighters take wrong paths on some
given map. If in doubt, don't touch.

Type: integer

Default value: 50
Min value: 1
Max value: 200

Defines the overall speed of the game. All other settings being equal, raising
this value will cause the game to behave faster. Everything will be faster,
except probably the display since your computer will calculate more game
positions in a given time and spend more CPU time. It will also increase
network traffic. Values between 10 and 50 really make sense.

Type: integer

Default value: 20
Min value: 0

Defines how hard fighters will attack sideways. It's an algorithm trick,
fighters attack by default the opponent right in front, but if there's no
fighter there, they will still try to attack someone else, maybe sideways. But
doing this their attack is not as strong. This parameter enables you to tune
this. This is a percentage.

Type: integer

Default value: 30
Min value: 1
Max value: 95

Defines the proportion of the whole available space, which will be occupied by
an army at the beginning of the game. You can either imagine playing with
almost empty maps, or play very crowded with almost no space left. This is a
percentage, but will be multiplied by itself to get the actual surface. That
is, 50 means 50%*50%, that is, a square of 1/2 the size of a square map, so it
represents 25% (1/4) of the total surface.

Default value: 0
Min value: 0
Max value: 1

If set to 1, the core algorithm with fire a separate thread to spread the
gradient. By default this is turned off (set to 0). Consider this as an
experimental feature, the program is already rather heavily threaded, turning
this on will probably not offer any significant performance gain, even on SMP

Type: integer

Default value: 3
Min value: 1
Max value: 12

Defines how many times the gradient is spread per round. Gradient spread is a
very Liquid War 6 specific feature, just remember that the more often you do
it, the more accurately fighters will move. That is, you will be sure they
really take the shortest path. Usually this does not have much effect, the
default value should fit in most cases, but you might want to decrease it on
very simple maps where the gradient is obvious, or increase it on complex maps
where you want fighters to be real smart.

@subsection total-armies-size
@deffn {Command-line option} @code{--total-armies-size=<value>}
@deffnx {Environment variable} @code{LW6_TOTAL_ARMIES_SIZE}
@deffnx {XML key} @code{total-armies-size}
Type: integer

Default value: 60
Min value: 1
Max value: 95

Defines the proportion of the whole available space, which can be occupied by
all the armies present together. Setting this low, whenever a new team arrives
on the map, fighters might be stolen to other teams, otherwise the ame would
get too crowded. This allows you to play with reasonnably enough fighters with
2 players, while still allowing interesting gameplay with many players. This
is a percentage, but will be multiplied by itself to get the actual surface.
That is, 50 means 50%*50%, that is, a square of 1/2 the size of a square map,
so it represents 25% (1/4) of the total surface.

@subsection total-time
@deffn {Command-line option} @code{--total-time=<value>}
@deffnx {Environment variable} @code{LW6_TOTAL_TIME}
@deffnx {XML key} @code{total-time}
Type: integer

Default value: 900
Min value: 10
Max value: 864000

Defines the maximum time of the game, in seconds. Note that in some cases, the
game can end much earlier if some player has managed to win before the bell
rings. Also, technically, this value will be translated into rounds and moves,
and the game engine will wait until enough rounds and moves have been played.
So if the computer is too slow and the desired speed is not reached, then the
game will last for a longer time.

@subsection vertical-move
@deffn {Command-line option} @code{--vertical-move=<value>}
@deffnx {Environment variable} @code{LW6_VERTICAL_MOVE}
@deffnx {XML key} @code{vertical-move}
Type: integer

Default value: 1
Min value: 0
Max value: 7

Defines when to process a vertical move (along the Z 'depth' axis). If set to
0, fighters never spontaneously move along this axis. If set to 1, it will be
tried just after the first move failed. If set to 2, it will be tried just
after the second move failed. And so on.

@subsection x-polarity
@deffn {Command-line option} @code{--x-polarity=<value>}
@deffnx {Environment variable} @code{LW6_X_POLARITY}
@deffnx {XML key} @code{x-polarity}
Type: integer

Default value: 0
Min value: -1
Max value: 1

Defines how the map will be wrapped on the X (horizontal) axis. If set to 0,
nothing is wrapped. If set to 1, the right and left borders are connected, any
fighter can disappear on the right border and reappear on the left border, for
instance. If set to -1, it will be wrapped but also inversed, that is on a
320x240 map, a fighter disappearing on the left border at position (0,60) will
reapper on the right border at position (319,180). You can combine it with
'y-polarity'.

@subsection y-polarity
@deffn {Command-line option} @code{--y-polarity=<value>}
@deffnx {Environment variable} @code{LW6_Y_POLARITY}
@deffnx {XML key} @code{y-polarity}
Type: integer

Default value: 0
Min value: -1
Max value: 1

Defines how the map will be wrapped on the Y (vertical) axis. If set to 0,
nothing is wrapped. If set to 1, the top and bottom borders are connected, any
fighter can disappear on the top border and reappear on the bottom border, for
instance. If set to -1, it will be wrapped but also inversed, that is on a
320x240 map, a fighter disappearing on the bottom border at position (40,239)
will reapper on the top border at position (280,0). You can combine it with
'x-polarity'.

@subsection z-polarity
@deffn {Command-line option} @code{--z-polarity=<value>}
@deffnx {Environment variable} @code{LW6_Z_POLARITY}
@deffnx {XML key} @code{z-polarity}
Type: integer

Default value: 0
Min value: 0
Max value: 1

Defines how the map will be wrapped on the Z (deep) axis. If set to 0, nothing
is wrapped. If set to 1, when using a 4 layer map, for instance, fighters on
layer 1 will be able to go directly to layer 4 even if layers 2 and 3 are
filled with walls. A value of -1 is forbidden, this is not like x and y axis,
it does not really make sense. Consider this an advanced setting which might
save a layer in some tricky cases, the default value of 0 should fit in most
cases.
