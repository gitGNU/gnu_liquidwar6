Results for the game simulation, contains basic statistics about who won the games.

@defcv {Member} {lw6sim_results_s} {nb_teams}
@strong{Type:} @code{int}

@strong{Definition:} @code{int lw6sim_results_s::nb_teams}


Number of teams that were tested.

@defcv {Member} {lw6sim_results_s} {absolute}
@strong{Type:} @code{int}

@strong{Definition:} @code{int lw6sim_results_s::absolute[LW6MAP_MAX_NB_TEAMS]}


        
Absolute score. The unit is arbitrary and depends on the game type, the number of games. Well, it means nothing in itself, each team needs to be compared to the other ones.

@defcv {Member} {lw6sim_results_s} {percent}
@strong{Type:} @code{float}

@strong{Definition:} @code{float lw6sim_results_s::percent[LW6MAP_MAX_NB_TEAMS]}


        
Score as a percentage. This is based on several games played, the higher it is the stronger the team is.
