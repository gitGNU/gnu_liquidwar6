No problem... Here is the line from my script which makes the installer package file:

Code:
/Developer/Tools/packagemaker -build -p $PACKAGE_FILE -f content -r resources -i tmp/Info.plist -d plist/Description.plist


In my case the variable $PACKAGE_FILE is set to pkg/productname-x.x.x.pkg. Of course constant value of the -p switch can be used instead of variable but I run this script in several runs with different values.

The -f switch defines package contents directory (content in my case). And it is the same directory I used earlier when I was working with the GUI version of Package Maker.

The resources directory passed to -r switch contains files to be included to generated installer package. There are three files in this directory: background.jpg, License.txt and Welcome.txt

Info.plist and Description.plist are included to the generated package file too. I have them in different source locations because Description.plist is the same across all versions of the installers while the tmp/Info.plist is generated dynamically based on Info.plist template (I just modify it a bit in few steps earlier in the script to change the bundle version in the template but it's not very important).

And that's all - after this line I get the destination package file (*.pkg) which is further processed with the hdiutil tool to make a disk image file (*.dmg) and uploaded to ftp server Wink

In any case I paste also the both .plist files. I'm almost sure that I got them from the package made earlier with the GUI version and modified them a little to actual needs.

The Info.plist file:
Code:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">

   <false/>
   <key>IFPkgFormatVersion</key>
   <real>0.10000000149011612</real>
</dict>
</plist>


... and the Description.plist file:
Code:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
   <key>IFPkgDescriptionDescription</key>
   <string>My Great product ;)</string>
   <key>IFPkgDescriptionTitle</key>
   <string>Product Name</string>
</dict>
</plist>


Hope this helps Smile
