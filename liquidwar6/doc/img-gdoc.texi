@deftypefun {lw6img_jpeg_t *} {lw6img_screenshot_new} (lw6ker_game_state_t * @var{game_state}, char * @var{user_dir}, int @var{quality})
@var{game_state}:  game_state to create a screenshot from

@var{user_dir}:  user directory

@var{quality}:  quality, from 0 to 100

Creates a JPEG screenshot from a game state. The @code{user_dir} parameter
is used to build a file name and then use it
to write data on disk, it is then read and kept in memory.
Globally it's not that bad to store it for we do not generate
screenshots that often, and it's nice for debugging to have it so
developping a RAM-only writer wouldn't make it a blast anyway.

@strong{Return value:}  dynamically allocated object.

@deftypefun {void} {lw6img_screenshot_free} (lw6img_jpeg_t * @var{screenshot})
Frees a JPEG screenshot.

@strong{Return value:}  none.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun {int} {lw6img_test} (int @var{mode})
@var{mode}:  0 for check only, 1 for full test

Runs the @code{img} module test suite.

@strong{Return value:}  1 if test is successfull, 0 on error.
