5.2.2 API
---------

 -- Function: int lw6bot_init (lw6bot_backend_t * BACKEND,
          lw6bot_seed_t * SEED)
     BACKEND:  backend to use

     SEED:  parameters required to build bot (game state, among other
     things)

     Initializes a bot object. Must be performed before any other call.
     The seed is absolutely required, for a bot really needs to know
     what map/context it's working on, including at creation time

     *Return value:*  1 on success, 0 on failure.

 -- Function: void lw6bot_quit (lw6bot_backend_t * BACKEND)
     BACKEND:  unitialize a bot backend

     Closes a bot, but does not free all ressources.

 -- Function: int lw6bot_next_move (lw6bot_backend_t * BACKEND, int *
          X, int * Y)
     BACKEND:  bot to work on

     X:  next x position (out param)

     Y:  next y position (out param)

     Queries the bot for its next move, this is actually the one
     interesting function in the whole bot API.

     *Return value:*  1 on success, 0 on failure.

 -- Function: char * lw6bot_repr (lw6bot_backend_t * BACKEND)
     BACKEND:  bot to represent

     Gives a human readable representation of bot

     *Return value:*  dynamically allocated string.

 -- Function: lw6sys_assoc_t * lw6bot_get_backends (int ARGC, const
          char * [] ARGV)
     ARGC:  argc, as passed to `main'

     ARGV:  argv, as passed to `main'

     List available bot backends. The hash contains pairs with id and
     name for each backend. The id is the technical key you can use to
     load the backend, the name is something more readable you can
     display in an interface. The backend objects themselves are not
     instanciated by this (in fact, they are, but released on the fly)
     you need to load and initialize them afterwards.

     *Return value:*  hash containing id/name pairs.

 -- Function: lw6bot_backend_t * lw6bot_create_backend (int ARGC, const
          char * [] ARGV, const char * NAME)
     ARGC:  argc, as passed to `main'

     ARGV:  argv, as passed to `main'

     NAME:  string containing bot key, typically got from
     `lw6bot_get_backends'

     Creates a bot backend, this is just about loading the dynamic
     library if needed, and/or check bot engine is available, and
     connect to it. It does not perform initialization.

     *Return value:*  bot backend.

 -- Function: void lw6bot_destroy_backend (lw6bot_backend_t * BACKEND)
     BACKEND:  bot backend to destroy

     Frees the ressources associated to a bot, which must have been
     properly uninitialized before.

     *Return value:*  none.

 -- Function: int lw6bot_test (int MODE)
     MODE:  0 for check only, 1 for full test

     Runs the `bot' module test suite. Will try several engines and
     query basic moves.

     *Return value:*  1 if test is successfull, 0 on error.

5.3.2 API
---------

 -- Function: void mod_brute_is_GPL_compatible ()
     Defined to tell mod_brute is compatible with GNU General Public
     License.  Of course it is. This function does nothing, but the
     fact it's declared makes its GPL compatibility obvious. Having
     this declared is required.

     *Return value:*  none

 -- Function: lw6sys_module_pedigree_t * mod_brute_get_pedigree ()
     Returns the pedigree for mod-brute, giving details about the
     module, including name, description, licence, date/time of
     compilation.

     *Return value:*  dynamically allocated object.

 -- Function: lw6bot_backend_t * mod_brute_create_backend ()
     Creates a mod-brute backend.

     *Return value:*  backend pointer.
