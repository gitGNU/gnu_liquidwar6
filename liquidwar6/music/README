The musics here are a collection of songs which will, by default, be played
randomly when playing Liquid War 6. They are all in Ogg Vorbis format, but
the game can also play midis, mods (.mod, .s3m, .xm) and possibly some
other files through SDL_mixer.

You're free to enhance this list by adding your own files and, additionnally,
maps (levels) can embed their own custom musics.

Below is the list of the files, and where they come from.

Menu (AKA "ambiance") music
===========================

Files have been taken from http://orbitalwintersong.org.uk/ and have been
composed by Tim Chadburn, which was also the composer of all the songs of the 
previous version of the game (Liquid War 5).

In-game music
=============

These Ogg Vorbis (.ogg -> http://vorbis.com/) were taken from Dogmazic:
http://www.dogmazic.net/
This site does have many free songs, including some released under the GNU GPL
("GNUArt") and therefore fully compatible with the game licensing scheme.
The filenames are believed to be sufficiently explicit to give the author,
the name of the song and the license as well. They have (the filenames, not
the files themselves) been slightly edited, mostly for syntax, because for
some reason the 'make dist' command and more precisely, tar, would not handle
files with more than 99 characters. Thanks to all these authors for
publishing their (great!) work under a Free (as in speech) license.
