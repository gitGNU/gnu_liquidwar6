Sinusoid

IDEA
Painted in Photoshop CS3. The practical purpose of this map was to use the wrap-around feature of LW6. The map is just a vertical sinus curve, with horizontal paths connecting it with itself. I'm a great fan of Art Nouveau, so I tried to make a lot of natural looking forms. Quite a bit of work!

GAMEPLAY
I used a really nifty trick here: I stole the rules.xml from another map, namely "Fishy".  I lowered the number of fighters to make this rather confusing map a less confusing experience.
