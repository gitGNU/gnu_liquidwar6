Infestival

IDEA
A map without any visible walls - only a few hatchet lines guides the way.

GAMEPLAY
Fighter-scale is only 2, which is possible because the armies are so small: single-army-size = 14 and total-armies-size = 40
The rest of the values is kinda mainstream, except fighter-new-health which I have lowered from 5000 to 2500, which gives the battle fronts a darker color.

TEAM COLORS
I had considered giving the fighters a red tone, but so far, all the colors are quite normal.
